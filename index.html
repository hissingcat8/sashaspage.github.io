      One sunny day in December of 2012 I found you. You were walking outside my
      apartment building, rummaging through piles of garbage looking for

        "There's this cute little puppy outside my building. I really want to
        bring her home with me. What do you think?"
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      And that's how this journey started. You were going to be here for a few
      days while we found you a forever home. A few days turned into weeks, then
      months, and now it's been almost 13 years. The cute puppy is now a senior
      dog. Her face has turned gray and her joins are starting to give out a
      little. Despite all this, her excitement when I grab the leash to take for
      a walk is still the same: jumping up and down, howling and barking.
